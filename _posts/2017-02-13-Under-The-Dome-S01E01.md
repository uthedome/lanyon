<p>Dale "Barbie" Barbara buries a man's body in the woods of Chester's Mill. As he is leaving the town, an invisible barrier descends on the borders of the township. Local newspaper reporter Julia Shumway, who was investigating mysterious propane deliveries, takes a special interest in Barbie after he saves the life of teenager Joe McAlister, whose parents are trapped out of town. Town councilman James "Big Jim" Rennie makes an emergency radio announcement, while police chief Duke Perkins and his deputy Linda Esquivel try to quell the rise of panic in the town. Big Jim's unstable son Junior kidnaps Angie McAlister when he begins to suspect she had an affair with Barbie. Carolyn Hill and her partner Alice Calvert are passing through Chester's Mill with their daughter Norrie when the barrier appears and Norrie has what they think is an epileptic seizure. Julia takes Barbie into her home, where he realizes the man he buried was her husband. Duke suggests to Linda that the entire town is being punished and is about to reveal a dark secret about the town when his pacemaker explodes as he approaches the barrier. The U.S. military descends upon Chester's Mill as the world learns of the phenomenon.</p>
